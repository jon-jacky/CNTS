<p>
Real-time behavior of a multi-tasking program running on a pre-emptive
priority-based operating system is analyzed.  The operating system and
a collection of application tasks are modelled in Z.  Real time is
represented by an ordinary Z state variable.  The model is adapted to
a particular application by defining a state machine for each
task and associating execution times with each state.  The model is
analyzed by exhaustive simulation with the SMV model checker.  The
state transitions described by Z operation schemas are implemented in
the SMV programming language.  Invariants, preconditions, and
postconditions from the Z are translated to formulas in CTL, the SMV
specification language.  The SMV program is verified by checking these
formulas.  This detects coding errors in the SMV program and also
reveals inconsistencies in the original Z where operation schemas are
inconsistent with state invariants.  The errors were corrected.
Additional CTL formulas describe temporal properties that cannot be
expressed directly in Z.  The Z model is validated by checking an
example SMV program with CTL formulas that confirm scheduling results
from rate-monotonic analysis (RMA).  Another application that does not
satisfy the assumptions of RMA is analyzed, establishing that
high-priority tasks cannot indefinitely delay low-priority tasks and
real-time deadlines can be met.
