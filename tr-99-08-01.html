</center>
<p>
This document is the installation and operations manual for the
Clinical Neutron Therapy System (CNTS), intended for cyclotron
engineering staff and computer system administrators.  This manual
describes the hardware, system software, and network required by CNTS,
shows how to install and configure it, and explains how to revise the
configuration to accommodate changes in the department's computing
facilities.  It discusses operations including startup and shutdown,
troubleshooting and recovery procedures.  It discusses all the control
program configuration files, command files, executable program files
and data files, describing their names, locations, ownership,
protections, formats, contents, and use.  It explains how the therapy
control program interacts with the treatment planning program and the
prescription viewer/archiver.  It also discusses security issues.
