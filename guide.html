<strong>Abstract</strong>
</center>
<p>
This is the therapist's guide for the control of the isocentric
treatment unit at the Clinical Neutron Therapy System (CNTS) at the
University of Washington Medical Center.  This guide provides
instructions for performing typical treatment procedures.  A separate
reference manual provides detailed descriptions of each key, display,
message, etc.  This guide only describes the features of CNTS that
are needed to perform treatments and which are the therapist's
responsibility.  Other manuals describe the features that support
troubleshooting and recovering from problems, calibration, physics,
and engineering.
