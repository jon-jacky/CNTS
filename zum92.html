<h4>Formal Specification and Development of Control System Input/Output</h4>

<strong>Abstract</strong>

<p>
This report presents a formal specification in the Z notation for computations
that calculate control system state variables from input/output device register
contents (and vice-versa).  The specification is motivated by a particular
medical device but is quite generic and should be widely applicable.  The
specification is parameterized so that an implementation can be adapted to
different control systems by providing tables of configuration data, rather
than changing executable code.   Specified behaviors include detection of 
errors (where clients invoke operations with invalid parameters) and faults
(where input/output devices report invalid data).   The specification is not
merely descriptive, but is also used in the formal development (or
``refinement'')  of a detailed design.   From an initial specification which
naturally expresses the requirements, but is abstract and non-constructive, we
derive a functionally equivalent specification (also in Z), which suggests a
straightforward and efficient implementation in an imperative programming
language.   Formal justification is provided for each step in the derivation.
Conjectures are posed that formalize claims such as ``All inputs are handled
properly.''   Proving the conjectures could check for errors in the derivation,
and provide confidence that the formal specification expresses the intended
requirements.
