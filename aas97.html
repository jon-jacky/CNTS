<p>
We are developing a control program for a unique radiation therapy
machine.  The program is safety-critical, executes several concurrent
tasks, and must meet real-time deadlines.  We have produced about 250
pages of informal specification and design description, about 1200
lines of Z and about 6000 lines of code.  The Z description includes
an abstract level that expresses overall safety requirements and a
concrete level that serves as a detailed design, where Z paragraphs
correspond to data structures, functions and procedures in the code.
We express requirements in the abstract level that we would like to
check in the concrete level; checking these properties automatically
could reveal subtle errors in the detailed design.  We selected a
small portion of our design (13 transitions, 227 lines of Z,
corresponding to 331 lines of code) and performed a pencil-and-paper
(non-automated) analyses that revealed several errors.  We translated
this portion of our Z model to the SMV input language.  The
translation requires considerable simplification, where
Z predicates and numerical, structured variable values are encoded
as small integers.  We repeated our analyses using the SMV model
checker.  The automated analyses detected the known errors (we did not
detect any additional errors in our corrected version).
