<h4>Specifying a Safety-Critical Control System in Z</h4>

<strong>Abstract</strong>
</center>
<p>
This report presents a formal specification in the Z notation for a
safety-critical control system.  It describes a particular medical device but
is quite generic and should be widely applicable.  The specification emphasizes
safety interlocking and other discontinous features that are not considered in
classical control theory.   A method for calculating interlock conditions for
particular operations from system safety assertions is proposed; it is similar
to ordinary Z precondition  calculation, but usually results in stronger
preconditions.  The specification is presented as a partially complete
framework that can be edited and filled in with the specific features of a
particular control system.    Our system is large but the specification is
concise.   It is built up from components, subsystems, conditions and modes
that are developed  separately, but also accounts for behaviors that emerge at
the system level.  The specification illustrates several useful idioms of the Z
notation, and demonstrates that an object-oriented specification style can be
expressed in ordinary Z.
