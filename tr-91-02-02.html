<strong>Abstract</strong>

<p>
We modeled and tested an embedded controller that will be incorporated into a
medical process control application.   The controller (including customized
software) was developed by others, and its  original documentation does not
include a functional specification that is sufficiently complete and accurate
for our needs.  We proposed a functional specification of certain important
controller behaviors, based on the available documentation and behavior that we
had observed.  We used Petri nets for our specification notation.  From the
Petri net, we derived a series of tests intended to reveal whether our
provisional specification accurately characterized controller behavior.   The
method for deriving the tests from the Petri net is described.  The tests 
systematically traverse the Petri net and also present faults that should be
handled in a reasonable way.   Performing the tests revealed several errors in
our initial specification.   We modified our specification until it was
consistent with all observed behaviors, covering a wide range of situations.
