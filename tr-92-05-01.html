<strong>Abstract</strong>
</center>
<p>
The Clinical Neutron Therapy System (CNTS) at the University of Washington is a
computer controlled cyclotron and neutron therapy treatment facility.   This
document is the second volume of the functional specification of the CNTS
control system.   The first volume provides an overview
of the CNTS facility  and its control system.  
<p>
This document  contains detailed descriptions of the ``user interface'': what
the operators see and do at video terminals and control consoles to perform the
operations that were described briefly in the first volume.  Therefore, this
document can be used as an authoritative and comprehensive  operator's
reference manual, or as a source of material for a briefer user's guide that
might be easier to read.
<p>
The control system includes several terminals (also called workstations).
Chapter 2 describes the characteristics and operations that
are common to all of these terminals.  
<p> 
Chapter 3 describes the cyclotron control console.
<p>
Chapter 4 describes  operations that are performed at the
cyclotron operations terminal.
<p>
Chapter 5 describes the cyclotron status displays. 
<p>
Chapter 6 describes the therapy control consoles.
<p>
Chapter 7 describes controls and indicators in the
treatment rooms.
<p>
Chapter 8 describes the operations that are performed 
at each therapy operations terminal.
<p>
Chapter 9 describes the operations that are performed at the
diagnostic terminals.
<p>
Chapter 10 describes how to start up and shut down the control
system.
<p>
A forthcoming volume will contain detailed specifications of internal
operations involving the cyclotron and therapy apparatus itself, which are only
indirectly visible to users.
