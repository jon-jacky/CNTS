<strong>Abstract</strong>
</center>
<p>
We are developing a control program for a unique radiation therapy
machine.  The program is safety-critical, executes several concurrent
tasks, and must meet real-time deadlines. Development employs both
formal and traditional methods: we produce an informal specification
in prose (supplemented by tables, diagrams and a few formulas) and a
formal description in Z.  The Z description includes an abstract level
that expresses overall safety requirements and a concrete level that
serves as a detailed design, where Z paragraphs correspond to data
structures, functions and procedures in the code.  We validate the Z
texts against the prose specification by inspection.  We derive most
of the code from the Z texts by intuition and verify it by inspection
but a small amount of code is derived and verified more formally.  We
have produced about 250 pages of informal specification and design
description, about 1200 lines of Z and about 6000 lines of code.
Experiences developing a large Z specification and writing the program
are reported, and some errors we discovered and corrected are
described.
