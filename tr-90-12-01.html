<strong>Abstract</strong>
</center>
<p>
The Clinical Neutron Therapy System (CNTS) at the University of Washington is a
computer controlled cyclotron and neutron therapy treatment facility.  It
provides particle beams for cancer treatments with fast neutrons, production of
medical isotopes, and experiments in medical physics and radiobiology.  Its
control system includes six processors and handles over one thousand input and
output signals.  It must meet demanding requirements for availability,
equipment protection, and human safety.   Devices under computer control
include a 900 amp electromagnet and  a 39 ton rotating gantry.  
<p>
This document is the introduction to the functional specification
of the CNTS control system.   It is intended for an audience including 
physicists, engineers, computer science researchers and computer programmers. 
It contains much material describing the the cyclotron and treatment apparatus
and explaining how the whole system works.   This is necessary to enable the
specification to be understood by readers with diverse backgrounds.  It is also
necessary to explain the rationale for many features, particularly those
concerned with safety and equipment protection.  
<p>
We created an <em>informal</em> specification.  We describe the
control system as thoroughly as is practical using standard technical
English, supplemented by tables and diagrams.  The only mathematical,
or <em>formal</em>, contents are some algebraic equations and a few
Petri net diagrams (which are explained prior to their use).
