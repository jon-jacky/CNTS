<strong>Abstract</strong>
</center>
<p>
This report describes a computer control system for a radiation
therapy machine with an isocentric gantry and a multileaf collimator.
It discusses the motivation and rationale for some of the features and
development activities, and reports several measures of development
effort, performance, and quality, determined after
two years of operating experience.
</p>

<p> 
Notable features of the control system include construction based on
standard (vendor-independent) hardware and software components
connected by a network, a simple and efficient user interface, close
integration with the treatment planning system, automated record
keeping for patient quality assurance and machine maintenance, and
ease of maintenance and upgrading.  Separation of control functions
from data management functions results in a control program which is
small, fast, and feasible to analyze thoroughly.  Choice of features
and internal design were informed by fifteen years experience using
and maintaining computer controlled therapy machines.
</p>

<p>
The development method was chosen to ensure exceptional safety,
reliability, and clinical acceptability.  Much of the detailed
specification was expressed in <em>formal</em> (mathematical) notation.
This formal specification (not the prose description) served as the
basis for most coding, test planning, and safety analysis.  Testing
and reviews were supplemented by new automated analyses methods
including <em>theorem proving</em> and <em>model checking</em>.
