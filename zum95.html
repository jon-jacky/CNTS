<strong>Abstract</strong>

<p>
We wrote a formal specification in Z for the graphical user interface
of a radiation therapy machine.  We implemented our specification in a
Pascal dialect on a workstation that uses the X window system to
manage the keyboard and display.  We initially model the user
interface as a collection of separate Z operation schemas
corresponding to sections in the informal prose requirements document.
From these we derive a state machine model, represented as a state
transition table whose entries are schema names from the Z
specification.  Our state transition table format compactly represents
nested states that are modelled in Z by schema inclusion.  We
implement each table entry as a Pascal function or procedure.  We also
implement a dispatcher that selects the proper state transition
whenever any X event occurs; our dispatcher is the X event loop.  Our
dispatcher is a table-driven interpreter that can handle any state
transition system expressed in the format we defined.  We model the
dispatcher in Z and formally derive some of its code.
