<strong>Abstract</strong>
</center>
<p>
This report presents a formal (mathematical) specification for the
operator's console of a computer-controlled radiation therapy machine
equipped with a multileaf collimator.  This formal specification,
rather than the prose specification, serves as the primary reference
source for programming and test planning.
<p>
Specified functions include selecting treatment setups from a database
of stored prescriptions, setting up prescriptions on the treatment
machine manually or semi-automatically, checking that the setup
conforms to the prescription (with provision for overriding certain
settings, with operator confirmation), safety interlocking and
essential user interface features.  The specification supports physics
and experimental procedures as well as normal patient treatments.
<p>
The specification is expressed in the Z notation.  It formalizes the
requirements in a thorough informal (English prose) specification.
Its organization suggests a detailed design.
