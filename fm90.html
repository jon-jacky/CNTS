<strong>Abstract</strong>
</center>
<p>
This report describes preliminary experience writing formal specifications for
the control system for a cyclotron and neutron radiation therapy apparatus.  
This effort is motivated by high reliability and safety requirements, and a
need for concise, authoritative documentation to support coding, user
instruction, and testing.  Software development practices for therapy machines
and physics reserach acclerators are reviewed.  The operation of our machine
from the point of view of the cyclotron operator is described.    Many of the
cyclotron operator's controls are well-matched to model-based notations such as
Z and VDM.  Sample specifications in Z are presented for  representative
operations of the cyclotron control programs.   These  notations provide no
built-in way to represent the passage of time, and they cannot express some
features of concurrent systems and event-driven systems.  Alternative notations
are discussed, including Petri Nets and Software Cost Reduction project (SCR)
notation.  We conclude that it is practical to attempt a comprehensive formal
specification of our application, and anticipate that this will be a valuable
supplement to traditional development practices.
