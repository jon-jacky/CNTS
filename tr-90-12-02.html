<strong>Abstract</strong>
</center>
<p>
The Clinical Neutron Therapy System (CNTS) at the University of Washington is a
computer controlled cyclotron and neutron therapy treatment facility.  It 
provides proton beams which are used to produce fast neutrons for cancer
treatments, and proton as well as other charged particle beams for medical 
radionuclide production and for experiments  in medical physics and
radiobiology.  The facility has been in operation since 1984. 
<p>
The major components of the CNTS system are a Scanditronix MC50 cyclotron, an
isocentrically mounted neutron beam generator, a fixed horizontal beam neutron
generator, an isotope production station, beam transport system, beam
diagnostics, hard wired safety system, vacuum and cooling systems and computer
control system.  A more detailed description of the control system 
is found in Technical Report 90-12-01.
